## How it works

The project currently works by including a 8-bit shift register connected to the bus

## How to test

Input your two numbers MSB first (using the SI pin), pulsing the clock after inputting each individual bit.

## External hardware

A sequence of 8 LEDs is hooked up to the outputs to display the final number in binary.
